#### sjkelly - Motivation

A brief snippet from my [senior thesis](https://github.com/sjkelly/MQP) proposal: 

>With the advent of consumer level 3D printing, there has been an increased
>demand for Computer Aided Design (CAD) software. 3D printing allows for the
>user to customize designs before production. In order for this to be possible,
>geometric models need to be parametric. Typically the designer will expose a
>few parameters for the user to adjust and thus customize to their liking.
>Today many engineers use parametric design to adjust for manufacturing
>tolerances and component interfaces. Parametric design allows digital designs
>to adjust to local material availability. An example is exposing hardware sizes as
>Metric or Imperial measure in order to suit international markets. This allows
>for generalized application of appropriate technology and ecological sustainability.

I have long been involved with 3D printing and even longer involved in mechanical design.
My hope is that through Julia and 3D printing we will be able to start bridging the gap
between the digital and physical realms in a more seamless way through interaction and observation.
I am very much inspired by

in this regard.

In the short term, I am interested in understanding more about the computational
and mathematical representations of geometry. My senior thesis will be focused
on using Rvachev functions over implict surfaces to do FEA without generating
meshes. The "moon shot" objective is to feed the results of FEA back into
parameterized models to do optimization.
